Input/output notes

* All element that will be referenced by JS need to have an id or other ways to select them.
* Contains place holder rather than labels
* Script should be after body

let name_input = document.getElementById("name");
let age_input = document.getElementById("age");
let btn = document.getElementById("btn");
let output = document.getElementById("output");

//Get all ids from html and giving them values

name_input.value

//Get stuff out

output.innerHTML

//Put stuff in 

btn.addEventListener

//when you do something to it like click, event happense
